My thoughts on Cooperate Culture - or how to democratize your company.

The Spartans fell because they stopped having babies, much like Japan.
But what they did have was two Kings, just like our government that has multplie branches of Government.

The best REAL job I ever had doing real programming was working at O'Reilly Media Inc.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/timo3/

As you can see the company is actually run by Baldwin, but the company's vision is Tim's job.

This is just like Sparta:

Tim's company is one of the last solid book selling companies that is still making money.
The reason is he went from O'Reilly and Associates to O'Reilly Media Inc. The hard books are for us geezers from the Cold War before the internet. But the main seller in books are ebooks. But Tim offers so much more (http://oreilly.com).


My vision for Setechi takes this concept a bit further.
I go back to what made Silicon Valley so great (before there was all that money
It was a bunch of hippies learning how to code.

## So here it is: I'd merge the old HP way with Tim's company.

You take care of your employees for life. That means you do everything in your power to help them grow with your company.
Even if that means replacing them temporalily. In the mean time they can fix what ever issue they are facing with their loved ones.

Tim is already doing that. It is called taking a vacation. The difference is the diffence between explicit and implicit (http://writingexplained.org/implicit-vs-explicit-difference).

## Reason:
I was let go from O'Reilly for not showing up for work.
Best thing that ever happened to me. Took a year, but I finally got help.

Hope it helps you with your company,

-Morio
